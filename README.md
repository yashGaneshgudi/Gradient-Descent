gradientDescent file shows a gradient descent with 2 random m,c values.

I encountered diffuculties using the learning rate (a) so theres a program attached to calculate the optimal learning rate(a) based on the amount of iterations done.
PATTERN --> the higher the iterations the lower the learning rate!
