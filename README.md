3D Visualisation with datapoints (x,y,z)

5 Dimension Example available containing (x, y, z, w, v).See code the m,c values are given with an accuracy% as you can't visualise more dimensions.

I encountered diffuculties using the learning rate (a) so theres a program attached to calculate the optimal learning rate(a) based on the amount of iterations done.
PATTERN --> the higher the iterations the lower the learning rate!
My understanding is a high learning rate causes overshooting of values as bigger jumps occur ,so less iterations.
Whereas a low learning rate slowly finds the optimal solution ,but requires more iterations.
